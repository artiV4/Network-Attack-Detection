Detection and Classification of Network Attacks using various Machine Learning models

For PerFlow feature selection, the Decision Tree model achieved the highest performance with an average accuracy of 99.38%, precision of 99.39%, recall of 99.38%, and F1 score of 99.38%. The Random Forest and Recurrent Neural Network models also performed exceptionally well, with accuracies of 99.19% and 99.19%, respectively. These high scores indicate that the models based on PerFlow features are highly effective in classifying network traffic with minimal misclassifications. Notably, the Decision Tree's model's superior performance underscores its robustness in handling the broader contextual information provided by PerFlow features.

In contrast, the PerPacket feature selection models showed comparatively lower performance. The best-performing model, the Random Forest, achieved an average accuracy of 86.72%, precision of 86.02%, recall of 86.72%, and F1 score of 86.19%. While these results are still strong, they are noticeably lower than those of the PerFlow models. This disparity suggests that PerPacket features, which focus more on individual packet characteristics such as header length and protocol type, may not capture the comprehensive patterns necessary for optimal classification as effectively as PerFlow features.
